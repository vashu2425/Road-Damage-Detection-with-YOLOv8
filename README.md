## **Features**
- **YOLOv8 Model**: Utilizes a larger YOLOv8 model (`yolov8m.pt`) for enhanced performance.
- **Custom Dataset**: Trained on road damage data for real-world applications.
- **Augmentation**: Includes mosaic, mixup, and dropout for better generalization.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Reports precision, recall, and mean Average Precision (mAP).
- **Visualization**: Displays prediction results for easy interpretation.
